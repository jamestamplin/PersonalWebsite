I'm an entreprenuer currently on sabattical.

I occasionally invest in startups as a Founder Partner with [Founder Collective](http://www.foundercollective.com/).

Together with [Andrew Lee](twitter.com/startupandrew), I've started 4 companies, the most successful was [Firebase](firebase.com) which was acquired by Google in 2014 and now powers the majority of mobile apps.

I studied Industrial and Systems Engienering at the Univeristy of Wisconsin and Univeristy of Warwick, and grew up between Minnesota in the US and Reading in England.
