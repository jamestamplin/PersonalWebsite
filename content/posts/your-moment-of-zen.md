For the past 16 years [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart](http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart) has been a constant. Monday to Thursday you could flip on the TV and see a familiar face dissecting global events.

Stewart called out bullshit with wit and insight that resonated more than any other voice in popular culture. Through four elections, two wars, September 11th, and personal challenges, his analysis and humor made a turbulent world seem more sane.

The man took people to task when they deserved it and called out institutional hypocrisy with levity and sincerity. The world needed him. The world needs more people like him.

For me, his most memorable monologue followed September 11th, 2001:

Thank you, Jon.
